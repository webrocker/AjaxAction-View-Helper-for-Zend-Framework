h2. Synopsis

AjaxAction view helper is a plug-in replacement for the Action view helper. It transforms synchronous requests to asynchronous XHR-calls with no frills.

h2. Installation

Just copy the files AjaxAction.php to Your APPLICATION_PATH/views/helpers directory,  ajax.phtml to Your APPLICATION_PATH/views/_partials directory and make sure that the autoloader can load the helper. If You just created a Zend Framework project with Zend Studio or zf-command You should be fine without any modifications.

What JavaScript library You use is up to You, just modify the APPLICATION_PATH/views/_partials/ajax.phtml to work with Your library.

h2. Usage

In view just replace

<?php echo $this->action('gettweets', 'content', null, array()); ?>

with this

<?php echo $this->ajaxAction('gettweets', 'content', null, array(), '_partials/ajax.phtml'); ?>
